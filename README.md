## Project Description
Gotta Go - Bathroom Locator, my Epicodus Capstone project:

##### Name of Student:
Kendra Kelly

##### Name of Project:
Gotta Go

##### Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:
Bathroom finder by location. Focused on the needs of the person.

##### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Uses a map API (google or other) to find the users location and displays the nearest bathrooms and a rundown of their features.
* Creating and/or connecting to a database that includes these bathroom locations and information.
* Information about bathrooms include: gender neutrality, handicap accessibility, how to access (code needed or purchase requirement).

##### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* Google Maps, Mapbox or another Map API.
* Refuge Restrooms API, or possibly build one from scratch if needed.
* React, Redux, Sass, Webpack, JavaScript.

##### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* A form that allows visitors to add a bathroom and it's appropriate features.
* Add more information about the bathroom within the database. This includes information about stalls, cleanliness, size, etc.
* Great design including Sass.

##### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Sass
* Firebase

## User Needs/Wishes:
1.  As a user I would like to enter a location and be able to see a list of bathrooms located near me for easy access.
2.  As a user I would like to have the app automatically render bathrooms near me by my location so that I don't have to manually search.
3.  As a user I would like to be able to see a map and see the bathrooms near me visually represented for navigation purposes.
4.  I would like to know of the nearest bathroom has handicap access and room for wheelchairs.
5.  I would like to know if the bathrooms are gendered and are appropriately setup for my needs.
6. I would like to know what I need to do to access the bathroom. Is a code needed, if so what is it? Do I need to make a purchase prior to access?
